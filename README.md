**In this React App I have only designed frontend for the zomato.**

The feature of my project is Augmented Reality (AR) Menu Viewing.
The "Augmented Reality (AR) Menu Viewing" feature aims to revolutionize the menu browsing and 
ordering experience within the Zomato app by leveraging AR technology to provide users with 
immersive and interactive menu exploration capabilities. This feature is strategically important for 
Zomato to differentiate its platform, increase user engagement, and drive business growth.

1.User discovers menu viewing feature while browsing Menus on app.
2.User interacts with menu items by tapping or swiping to view detailed descriptions, 
images, and pricing information
3.By hovering on menu items images they can see the clear texture of the menu dish.
